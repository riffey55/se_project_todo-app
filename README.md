## 💡 Why This Project?

This app was built to strengthen my understanding of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and **modular JavaScript architecture**.  
It showcases how reusable class components—like `FormValidator` and `Todo`—help keep a project organized, scalable, and easy to maintain.  
Beyond functionality, I focused on clean **BEM-based styling** and creating a simple, accessible user experience.

---

## 🪶 Overview

A simple, object-oriented **To-Do List App** built during **TripleTen Sprint 7** to demonstrate modular JavaScript structure and class-based UI components.  
Users can add tasks, delete them, and mark them as completed—all handled through dynamic DOM rendering and reusable classes.

## 💡 Reflection: How Project 8 Builds on Project 7

Project 8 represents a shift from working with an external API (Project 7 — Spots) to designing independent client-side logic.  
While Spots focused on server communication and data retrieval, this project required me to manage my own data, build custom state handling, and design modular DOM components.

By applying the same architectural principles without relying on a backend, I learned how to design full client-side data flows.  
This project marks a key point where I began thinking more like a full-stack developer—designing both the logic and the experience.
